    <p>This section displays the projects I have completed, which mainly revolve around machine learning, statistical modeling, and Shiny apps.

<p><a href="/images/safaricom.pdf" >1. Stock Price Prediction</a></p>
<p>This project utilizes stock prices of Safaricom, a telecommunications company in Kenya (registered as SCOM in the Nairobi Stock Exchange), for predicting stock returns. Machine learning algorithms such as Lasso, Ridge, and Extreme Gradient Boosting models are employed to predict the direction of Safaricom&rsquo;s stock returns (up or down). The project involves essential steps like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning to optimize the accuracy of the predictions.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/wagathu/StockDistFit.git"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2. StockDistFit Package</a></p>
<p>In this project, a package called StockDistFit was developed in R. The package offers a set of functions designed to fit probability distributions to stock market data and determine the most suitable distribution for a given asset(based on Akaike Information Criterion(AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion(BIC)). The main objective was to provide a convenient tool for analyzing and modeling the distribution of stock market returns.</p>
<p>The StockDistFit package, which encompasses various statistical methods and techniques, was created to facilitate the estimation of distribution parameters and the evaluation of goodness-of-fit measures. By utilizing this package, users can gain insights into the underlying probability distribution of stock returns and make informed decisions based on the analysis.</p>
<p>The StockDistFit package is now available on The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), a widely recognized repository for R packages. It can be easily accessed and utilized by the R community for their own research and analysis of stock market data. Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions to further enhance this package are always welcome.</p>

<p><a href="/images/SentimentAnalysis.pdf" >3. Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>In this project, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the sentiment of the novel &ldquo;Wreck of the Titan.&rdquo; This captivating novel, which remarkably predicts the sinking of the Titanic years before it actually occurred, served as the focal point for research.</p>
<p>Using various lexicons in R, I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the text, aiming to uncover and classify the emotions expressed throughout the narrative. By employing sentiment analysis techniques and leveraging specialized lexicons, we sought to unravel the overarching sentiment and thematic elements present in the novel.</p>
<p>In this study, the focus was to examine and analyze the emotions experienced by the individuals who were onboard &ldquo;Wreck of the Titan&rdquo; from the beginning of their journey until its tragic end. By delving into the text, our aim was to capture and understand the range of emotions portrayed by the characters as they navigated through the voyage(<em>which could actually portray the emotions of the people in the actual titanic ship</em>).</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://wagathu.shinyapps.io/demography/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4. Kenya Demography Shiny App</a></p>
<p>In this project, I developed a Shiny web application in R called the &ldquo;Kenya Demography App.&rdquo; The main objective of the app was to provide a visual representation of Kenya&rsquo;s population trends using data from the 2019 Kenya National Wide Census and other demographic characteristics dating back to 1950.</p>
<p>The Kenya Demography App offered an interactive platform that allow users to explore and analyze various demographic indicators over time. The app utilizes line charts and choropleth maps to showcase population growth rates, fertility rates, and other important demographic characteristics.</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="/images/load_forecasting.pdf" >5. Electricity Demand Load Forecasting</a></p>
<p>In this ongoing project, I am developing an Electricity Load Forecasting system aimed at predicting and forecasting the electricity load demand in Kenya. The goal is to utilize various variables, including holidays and time of the day, to build an accurate model that can provide insights into the future electricity load patterns.</p>
<p>As of now, I am working on a prototype of the project. The dataset used for this prototype has been obtained from the Kaggle platform, as the compilation of the actual data is still in progress. This dataset serves as a starting point for my analysis and model development. I am actively working on gathering and preprocessing data, designing the CNN architecture, and training the model.</p>
<p>By incorporating variables such as holidays and time of the day, I aim to capture the seasonal and daily fluctuations in electricity load demand. This will enable me to create a robust forecasting model that can provide valuable insights for efficient electricity generation, distribution, and planning.</p>
<p>The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate electricity load forecasting system that can assist in decision-making processes within the energy sector. By predicting future electricity demand, I can optimize resource allocation, plan for infrastructure upgrades, and ensure a stable and efficient electricity supply for the country.</p>
